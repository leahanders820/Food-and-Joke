## Food-and-Joke is an application that allows the user to generate a random recipe with a random joke.
<!-- Name of Project and what it does -->
This site is meant to deliver a meal recipe and a joke on demand and provide local storage for saving favorite recipes and jokes and being able to recall them to the page.
One can also request a new recipe or joke and save either or both.
On refresh of the page, the site will reset and only the main header content will be visible. This has not been enabled for requests to the api's that have already been made, but could be a future enhancement.
This application will let users have access to a random recipe and a joke. The recipe will come with: ingreadiants and their mesurements, step by step instructions, 
a video link, and a website link. The joke will be random at the click of a button and both will have a save option.
Additionally, display and hide functions for all cards or buttons has not been implemented, another future enhancement.
Hope you like this site!
